Overview
--------

We use [Benchling](https://benchling.com) to design and organize our molecular cloning projects. If you don't have an account and / or not part of the lab, please tell Bin to send you an invitation.

In Benchling, you can design primers either using the "Assembly Wizard" or "Primer Design" functions, or you can manually create or import an oligo. Either way, once you have your oligos designed and checked, you can then register it with the lab oligo database. We order our oligos from IDT through the Iowa Institute of Human Genetics. Use this [link](https://webapps1.healthcare.uiowa.edu/RAMS-DNACore/Default.aspx). If you don't have an account, either ask Bin to add you, or just give him the oligo IDs (oHXXX).

Protocol
--------

1.  Design your primers in Benchling.
2.  Save your primers in a folder named "primer" under your project folder.
3.  Double check the sequence to make sure that you get the correct strand, and have the right amount of overhang etc.
4.  Once everything looks correct, open the oligo and navigate to "METADATA" tab. Find the "Schema" box and choose "Oligo" in the dropdown box. Fill in the project ID and any other information if you know them.
5.  Click the "Register" button on the top. In the pop out window, select "Organization Collection" (you can leave the "My Collection" checked or unchecked, it's up to you). In the "Name and Registry ID Settings", choose "Generate new registry IDs". If there is no error, click Register. Now your oligos are registered into the lab database and you are ready to order using the oH numbers.

Notes
-----

We register the oligos because this allows us to use the "Find existing primers" function in Benchling when we design new primers. Often times you will find the lab already has the primers you need. This is especially true for molecular cloning, where there are many standard parts in plasmids.

Please feel free to post comments, questions, or improvements to this protocol. Happy to have your input! Please sign your name to your note by adding '''*~~~~''': to the beginning of your tip.
