Overview
--------

Synthetic complete dropout media (SC-N with the nutrient N dropped out) is the media we use in the lab for selecting strains that have repaired an auxotrophy (e.g. selection on SC-URA plates after transforming with a URA+ plasmid or DNA fragment) or for persistent selection for the ability to grow without nutrient N (e.g. for maintaining a URA+ plasmid, the strain is always grown in SC-URA media).

Synthetic complete is the name given to the media with nothing dropped out (i.e. with all amino acids and other nutrients added the media). You can use synthetic complete for microscopy (it is much better for this purpose than YPD) but low fluorescence media (LFM) is preferable.

Materials
---------

-   Yeast Nitrogen Base without Amino Acids (Difco, DF0919 from Fisher)
-   Agar (Fisher Bioreagent BP1423-500)
-   50% Glucose Solution (w/v; Biochem Store #1004755)
-   Amino Acide Dropout mix ([recipe]())
-   Distilled water

Stock Solutions
---------------

**50% Glucose Solution**

For 1 liter of 50% glucose:

1.  Dissolve 500g Dextrose (Biochem Store 1004755) to 400 mL of deionized water with constant stirring. Add the water to the beaker first then sugar! Heat may help the sugar to dissove (use the hot plate & stirrer combo)
1.  Once the sugar has dissolved, bring the entire solution up to 1 litre. Autoclave for 20 min on liquid cycle, then store the stock solution in the glass door cabinet with other autoclaved stocks.

**Amino acid dropout mix**

-   See [Amino Acid Dropout Mix]()

Protocol
--------

For 1 liter of solid media, add to a 2L flask the following:

-   6.7g yeast nitrogen base
-    20g agar
-   deionized water to 960 mL

Put a magnetic stir bar into the flask, wrap the mouth of the flask with aluminum foil and put a piece of autoclave tape. Autoclave for 20 min on the liquid cycle. Once cooled to about 55&deg;C add 40 mL of 50% glucose solution. Pour plates

For 1 liter of liquid media, follow the same recipe above, except for the agar.
