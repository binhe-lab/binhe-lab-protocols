# Overview
This page is meant to serve as a resource for new members joining the lab. Please utilize this page as an initial checklist of things to do and learn as you are settling in. If there is something missing that would be helpful to new lab members, ADD IT!

# ID & logistics of the lab
- If you are completely new to the university, go to the [IOWA One Card Center](https://idcard.uiowa.edu/iowa-one-card) to register yourself and obtain an ID card. Contact Bin to get you access to the biology and biology building east entrance, as well as a key to our lab.

# Online accounts
We use a number of web apps to help manage inventory and communicate within the lab. You will need to establish accounts with them 
# Safety training
Please log on to the [EH&S training page](https://ehs.research.uiowa.edu/icon-safety-training-information). Most of you will be choosing the "UI non-paid student login". Once you are at the course selection site, choose the following course numbers and complete them on ICON. Notice that W008CM and W004BO will ask you to print one sheet of "Site Specific Training". We need to go through that sheet together and both Bin and you must sign it.
