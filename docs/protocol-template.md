Overview
--------

This template as well as many protocols in this repo are modified from the McClean lab's [OpenWetLab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/McClean:_Protocol_Template).

This is a template for how to write a new protocol in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/binhe-lab/lab-protocols) for our lab. Here is [how you can become a member of the lab on GitHub so as to clone and contribute to the protocols](). In your real protocol, a description of what the protocol is and when to use it would go here.
